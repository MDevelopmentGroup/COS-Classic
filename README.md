## COS-Vintage Syntax Theme

COS-Vintage is a light syntax theme for [Atom](http://atom.io/) inspired by [Macrabbit Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/)'s default syntax highlighting color scheme, and by the [Soda Theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme) for Sublime. It features bright, primary colors on a white background. It is a syntax theme only, and will not affect the Atom UI.
